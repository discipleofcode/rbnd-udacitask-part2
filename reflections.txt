# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
   about 6 hours, reading and understanding specs took most of my time
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
   Well I'm not sure, Im glad all functions in app.rb passed
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
   once more:
  a) New item type - meeting
  b) Generating random meetings - generate_meetings function
  c) not reaaally a feature but there is a divination list

  why? I wanted to try faker gem, so I've added meetings to randomize input data (name & date)
  divination list came later, wanted to check when ill meet my end :D - 2089. Still have much time to learn!
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  It would be nice to randomize input data for all item types but I couldnt find useful data for events and todos
  I think it's quite common use, maybe I should learn how to extend gems :o ?
